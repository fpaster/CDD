## Introduction

Sometimes picking the right car is not as easy as it seems. There is always a tradeoff between horsepower (hp) and miles per gallon (mpg)

This app separates available cars into groups from economical to wasteful. The number of groups can automaticall be specified by the user.

---

## There are just so many different cars available
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
p = ggplot() +
    geom_point(data = mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = hp)) +
    ggtitle("Plot of fuel consumption in cars")
```

```{r fig.align="center"}
print(p)
```

For example put the slider to three to select three clusters:

The cars are clustered into three clusters:
